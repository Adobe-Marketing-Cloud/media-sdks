# Release Notes for iOS Media SDK 2.x

Included are notes from the latest major revision to current.

What's new in 2.x:

Lighter, Simpler implementation.
    - Streamlined implementation and configuration. With Media SDK 2.x, all the configuration and media tracking API calls are centralized through a single class: ADBMediaHeartbeat.
    - Error state recovery. Media SDK 2.x keeps track of the current state of the playback. By having internal state logic, Media SDK 2.x can ignore wrong API calls.
    - Clear difference between optional and required media tracking APIs. Optional media tracking features such as chapter tracking, ad tracking, bitrate change, etc. are now tracked through a single media tracking API: trackEvent:.
