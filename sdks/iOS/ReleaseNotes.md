# Release Notes for iOS VideoHeartbeat 2.x SDK

Included are notes from the latest major revision to current.

What's new in 2.x:

Lighter, Simpler implementation.
    - Streamlined implementation and configuration. With VHL 2.x, all the configuration and video tracking API calls are centralized through a single class: ADBMediaHeartbeat.
    - Error state recovery. VHL 2.x keeps track of the current state of the playback. By having internal state logic, VHL 2.x can ignore wrong API calls.
    - Clear difference between optional and required video tracking APIs. Optional video tracking features such as chapter tracking, ad tracking, bitrate change, etc. are now tracked through a single video tracking API: trackEvent:.
