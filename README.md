# Adobe Media SDK

## Adobe Analytics for Audio and Video
Adobe Analytics for Audio and Video is an add-on to the base Analytics offering that provides clients with robust measurement for audio, video and advertisements. Starting with v2.2.0 release, the Video Heartbeat Library (VHL) SDKs are renamed to Media SDKs to support Audio and Video tracking. The Media 2.2.0 SDK is fully backwards compatible with the VHL 2.x SDK series. The name change does not represent a functional break, simply a change in naming convention.
