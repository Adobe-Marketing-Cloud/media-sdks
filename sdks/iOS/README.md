MediaSDK-iOS
Media SDK for iOS

Starting with v2.2.0 release, the Video Heartbeat Library (VHL) SDKs are renamed to Media SDKs. The Media 2.2.0 SDK is fully backwards compatible with the VHL 2.x SDK series. The name change does not represent a functional break, simply a change in naming convention. All the existing public APIs with v2.x series has no impact due to SDK name change.
